1-in personal you will find the dataset i used for this project also you will find the ipynb file i used to scrap it
2-train.py is the file used to train my pytorch model in here you already have data.pyh so i already implemented the model 
if you want to train it on your own then delete the data.pth file and run train.py before running main.py



if you have more questions dont hesitate to ask me
